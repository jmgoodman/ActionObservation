# ActionObservation

A code repository to accompany the action-observation project.

More details will be filled in later. In this repository, I will include:
MirrorData class methods
Various utilities for manipulating MirrorData objects into useful formats, e.g. tensors or, as I call them, data loaves
Analysis of invidiual neurons:
  code for replicating PETHs
  code for replicating the PAIRS functional clustering analysis
Basic controls
  code for kinematic analysis
  code for EMG analysis
Manifold analysis:
  code for finding common component (or rather, family of common components)
Classification analysis:
  Parallelized LDA analysis
  Various controls
    contraction/expantion
    limitation to a particular subspace
    gain field/multiplicative model
    grip clustering based on kinematics
    grip alignment based on kinematics
